Why do birds suddenly appear
Every time you are near?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
Why do stars fall down from the sky
Every time you walk by?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
On the day that you were born the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
On the day that you were born the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
Wa, close to you
Wa, close to you
Ha, close to you
La, close to you

I don't really give a damn about the way you touch me
When we're alone
You can hold my hand
If no one's home
Do you like it when I'm away?
If I went and hurt my body, baby
Would you love me the same?
I can feel all my bones coming back
And I'm craving motion
Mama never really learned how to live by herself
It's a curse
And it's growing
You're a pond and I'm an ocean
Oh, all my emotions
Feel like explosions when you are around
And I've found a way to kill the sounds, oh
Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
I broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden?
Oh, and if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
I said no (I said no), I said no (I said no)
Listen close, it's a no
The wind is a-pounding on my back
And I found hope in a heart attack
Oh at last, it has passed
Now I've got it, and you can't have it
Baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
I broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden, oh
And if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide
Darling, when I'm fast asleep
I've seen this person watching me
Saying, "Is it worth it? Is it worth it? Tell me, is it worth it?"
Oh
'Cause there is something, and there is nothing
There is nothing in between
And in my eyes, there is a tiny dancer
Watching over me, he's singing
"She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a boy"
He's singing, "She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a line without a hook"
Oh baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
I broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden, oh
And if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide

She is something to behold
Elegant and bold
She is electricity
Running to my soul
Oh, oh, oh, oh
And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me
Will work each time
Calling me to come back to bed
Singing Georgia On My Mind
And I, and I
Lips generous and warm
You build me up like steps
Eyes innocent and wild
Remind me what it's like
Oh, oh, oh, oh
And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Pulling me back into the flames
And I'm burning up again
I'm burning up
And I, I never understood what was at stake
I never thought your love was worth it's wait
Well now you've come and gone
I finally worked it out
I worked it out
I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want it troubling your mind
Won't you let it be
I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want it troubling your mind
Won't you let it be
I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want it troubling your mind
Won't you let it be
I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want it troubling your mind
Won't you let it be
And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Pulling me back into the flames
And I'm burning up again, I'm burning up
And I, I never understood what was at stake
I never thought your love was worth it's wait
Well now you've come and gone
I finally worked it out
I worked it out
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, kay gandang pagmasdan
Ang iyong mga mata
Kumikinang-kinang
'Di ko maintindihan
Ang iyong mga tingin
Labis ang mga ningning
Langit ay bumaba
Bumababa pala ang tala
Tumingin ka sa 'king mga mata
At hindi mo na kailangan pang
Magtanong nang paulit-ulit
Ikaw lang ang iniibig
At kung 'di kumbinsido'y magtiwala ka
Hawakan ang puso't maniwala
Na ikaw lang ang s'yang inibig
Ikaw lang ang iibigin
At sa iyong paglalambing
Ako ay nahulog din
'Di ko alam kung ano ang gagawin
'Di ko alam kung saan titingin
Halik sa labi
Tinginan natin
'Di akalaing
Mahuhulog ka sa 'kin
Tumingin ka sa aking mga mata
At hindi mo na kailangan pang
Magtanong nang paulit-ulit
Ikaw lang ang iniibig
At kung 'di kumbinsido'y magtiwala ka
Hawakan ang puso't maniwala
Na ikaw lang ang s'yang inibig
Ikaw lang ang iibigin, sinta
At sa paglisan ng araw, akala'y 'di ka mahal
At ang nadarama'y hindi magtatagal
Malay ko bang hindi magpapagal
Iibigin kita kahit ga'no pa katagal
Tumingin ka sa 'king mga mata
At hindi mo na kailangan pang
Magtanong nang paulit-ulit
Ikaw lang ang iniibig
At kung 'di kumbinsido'y magtiwala ka
Hawakan ang puso't maniwala
Na ikaw lang ang s'yang inibig
Ikaw lang ang iibigin
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la (ah)
La-la-la-la (ah)
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la
Siya lang, la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la-la (ah)
La-la-la-la (ah)

'Di ko maintindihan ang nilalaman ng puso
Tuwing magkahawak ang ating kamay
Pinapanalangin lagi tayong magkasama
Hinihiling bawat oras kapiling ka
Sa lahat ng aking ginagawa
Ikaw lamang ang nasa isip ko, sinta
Sana'y 'di na tayo magkahiwalay
Kahit kailan pa man
Ikaw lamang ang aking minamahal
Ikaw lamang ang tangi kong inaasam
Makapiling ka habang-buhay, ikaw lamang, sinta
Wala na 'kong hihingin pa, wala na
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ayoko nang maulit pa ang nakaraang ayokong maalala
Bawat oras na wala ka, parang mabigat na parusa
'Wag mong kakalimutan na kahit nag-iba
Hindi ako tumigil magmahal sa 'yo, sinta
Sa lahat ng aking ginagawa
Ikaw lamang ang nasa isip ko, sinta
Sana'y 'di na tayo magkahiwalay
Kahit kailan pa man
Ikaw lamang ang aking minamahal
Ikaw lamang ang tangi kong inaasam
Makapiling ka habang-buhay, ikaw lamang, sinta
Wala na 'kong hihingin pa, wala na
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ikaw lamang ang aking minamahal
Ikaw lamang ang tangi kong inaasam
Makapiling ka habang-buhay, ikaw lamang, sinta
Wala na 'kong hihingin pa, wala na
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Aking sinta, ano ba'ng mayro'n sa iyo?
'Pag nakikita ka na, bumabagal ang mundo
'Pag ngumingiti ka, para bang may iba
'Pag tumitingin sa 'kin, mapupungay mong mga mata
Wala akong takas sa nakakalunod mong ganda, ha
Halika nga (ha, ha, ha)
Tingnan mo lang ang aking mga mata
'Wag kang titingin na sa iba
Akin ka na, wala nang iba (ha, ha, ha)
Andito 'ko hanggang sa 'ting pagtanda
Mamahalin kita basta't 'pag nahulog
Nakahawak ako, 'wag ka lang bibitaw
Habang-buhay na ako'y iyo
Wala nang ibang nakagawa sa 'kin nang ganito
Kundi ikaw, nag-iisang diyosa ng buhay ko
'Wag ka nang matakot, 'wag kang mangamba
Andito ako 'pag ika'y mag-isa
Wala akong takas sa nakakalunod mong ganda, ha
Halika nga (ha, ha, ha)
Tingnan mo lang ang aking mga mata
'Wag kang titingin na sa iba
Akin ka na, wala nang iba (ha, ha, ha)
Andito 'ko hanggang sa 'ting pagtanda
Mamahalin kita basta't 'pag nahulog
Nakahawak ako, 'wag ka lang bibitaw
Habang-buhay na ako'y iyo
Kahit ang likod mo'y kubang-kuba na
Kahit ang ulo mo'y puro uban na
Isasayaw ka hanggang sa pikit na ang ating mga mata (ha, ha, ha)
Wala naman na 'kong hiling pa
Basta't kasama ka, habang-buhay na kuntento ako
Basta't ikaw lang kasama, ikaw kasama ko
Aking sinta, ano ba'ng mayro'n sa iyo?
'Pag nakikita ka na, bumabagal ang mundo
Tingnan mo lang ang aking mga mata
'Wag kang titingin na sa iba
Akin ka na, wala nang iba (ha, ha, ha)
Andito 'ko hanggang sa 'ting pagtanda
Mamahalin kita basta't 'pag nahulog
Nakahawak ako, 'wag ka lang bibitaw
Habang-buhay na ako'y iyo
Tingnan mo lang ang aking mga mata
'Wag kang titingin na sa iba
Akin ka na, wala nang iba

Sa unang tingin, agad na nahumaling
Sa nagniningning mong mga mata
Ika'y isang bituin na nagmula sa langit
Hindi ko mawari ang taglay mong tinatangi
Sadya namang nakakabighani
'Di maipaliwanag ang nararamdaman
Namumukadkad ang aking ligaya
Sa tuwing ika'y papalapit na
Hawakan mo ang aking kamay
Oh, Paraluman, ika'y akin nang
Dadalhin sa 'di mo inaasahang paraiso
Palagi kitang aawitan ng Kundiman
'Di magsasawa, 'di ka pababayaan
Isasayaw kita hanggang sa walang-hanggan
Mga gunita na laging naiisip (naiisip)
Sumisilip (sumisilip) ang itinakda ng mahiwaga
Liwanag na dulot mo, nagbigay-sinag sa madilim kong mundo
Ibang-iba ako kapag ikaw na ang kapiling
Sumisiping ang buwan at mga bituin
Na para bang sumasang-ayon sa atin ang kalawakan (kalawakan)
Namumukadkad ang aking ligaya
Sa tuwing ika'y papalapit na
Hawakan mo ang aking kamay
Oh, Paraluman, ika'y akin nang
Dadalhin sa 'di mo inaasahang paraiso (paraiso)
Palagi kitang aawitan ng Kundiman
'Di magsasawa, 'di ka pababayaan
Isasayaw kita hanggang sa walang-hanggan
Pa-pa-para-pa-pa, para-pa-pa-para-Paraluman
Pa-pa-para-pa-pa, para-pa-pa-para-Paraluman
Pa-pa-para-pa-pa, para-pa-pa-para-Paraluman
Pa-pa-para-pa-pa, para-pa-pa-para-Paraluman
Himig ng tadhana
Sa atin ay tumutugma na
Himig ng tadhana
Sa atin ay tumutugma na
Himig ng tadhana
Sa atin ay tumutugma na
Oh, Paraluman, ika'y akin nang
Dadalhin sa 'di mo inaasahang paraiso
Palagi kitang aawitan ng Kundiman
'Di magsasawa, 'di ka pababayaan
Isasayaw kita, mamahalin kita
Hanggang sa walang-hanggan

San darating ang mga salita
Na nanggagaling sa aming dalawa
Kung lumisan ka wag naman sana
Ika'y kumapit na nang di makawala
Aking sinta ikaw na ang tahanan at mundo
Sa pagbalik mananatili na sa piling mo
Mundo’y magiging ikaw
Wag mag-alala kung nahihirapan ka
Halika na sumama ka
Pagmasdan ang mga tala
Aking sinta ikaw na ang tahanan at mundo
Sa pagbalik mananatili na sa piling mo
Mundo'y magiging ikaw
Limutin na ang mundo
Nang magkasama tayo
Sunod sa bawat galaw
Hindi na maliligaw
Hindi na maliligaw
Hindi na maliligaw
Hindi na maliligaw
Hindi na maliligaw
Hindi na maliligaw
Di na maliligaw
Hindi na maliligaw
Hindi na maliligaw
Hindi na maliligaw
Aking sinta ikaw na ang tahanan at mundo (mundo'y magiging ikaw)
Sa pagbalik mananatili na sa piling mo(mundo'y magiging ikaw)
Aking sinta (limutin na ang mundo)
Ikaw na ang tahanan at mundo (nang magkasama tayo mundo'y magiging ikaw)
Sa pagbalik (sunod sa bawat galaw)
Mananatili na sa piling mo (hindi na maliligaw mundo'y magiging ikaw)
Limutin na ang mundo
Nang magkasama tayo
Sunod sa bawat galaw
Hindi na maliligaw
Mundo'y magiging ikaw

There are times when I'm lying in my bed
How I bellow and cry from this stupid gate
And my eyes are like windshields on a rainy day
Almost rubbed-down, swelling
As I keep on dipping my face in these cold hands of mine
Heaven knows how embittered I am
'Cause this angel has flown away from me
Leaving me with drunken misery
I should have clipped her wings
And made her mine for all eternity
Now, this angel has flown away from me
Thought I had the strength to set her free
Did what I did because I love her so
Will she ever find her way back home to me? Oh-oh
I'm so tired, I feel like catching 40 winks
Being up all night in this elbow room
That puts me in a trance
Where hopes and dreams come true
Now, my lips are burning
And my eyes are hurting
From these fumes I make, still, I light another cigarette
Just to pass my time, oh
Heaven knows how embittered I am
'Cause this angel has flown away from me
Leaving me with drunken misery
I should have clipped her wings
And made her mine for all eternity
Now, this angel has flown away from me
Thought I had the strength to set her free
Did what I did because I love her so
Will she ever find her way back home to me? Oh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh



Little do you know
How I'm breakin' while you fall asleep
Little do you know
I'm still haunted by the memories
Little do you know
I'm tryin' to pick myself up piece by piece
Little do you know
I need a little more time
Underneath it all I'm held captive by the hole inside
I've been holding back for the fear that you might change your mind
I'm ready to forgive you, but forgettin' is a harder fight
Little do you know
I need a little more time
I'll wait, I'll wait
I love you like you've never felt the pain
I'll wait
I promise you don't have to be afraid
I'll wait
Love is here and here to stay
So lay your head on me
Little do you know
I know you're hurt while I'm sound asleep
Little do you know
All my mistakes are slowly drownin' me
Little do you know
I'm tryin' to make it better piece by piece
Little do you know I
I love you 'til the sun dies
Oh wait, just wait
I love you like I've never felt the pain
Just wait
I love you like I've never been afraid
Just wait
Our love is here, and here to stay
So lay your head on me
I'll wait (I'll wait), I'll wait (I'll wait)
I love you like you've never felt the pain
I'll wait (I'll wait)
I promise you don't have to be afraid
I'll wait
Love is here, and here to stay
So lay your head on me
Lay your head on me
So lay your head on me
'Cause little do you know I
I love you 'til the sun dies



If you leave me don't you ever think I want you go
'Cause I'm bound to you
All I need is you to wait for me and I'll be there for you
'Cause I'll run to you
My heart belongs to you
I'll take a piece of you
I don't know what's happening now
And all a lot thing have turned
I wish that I could turned back time
Back when I'm with you
But my heart belongs to you
I'll take a piece of you
My heart belongs to you
I'll take a piece of you
My heart belongs to you
I'll take a piece of you
My heart belongs to you
I'll take a piece of you

Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile
I watch her go with a surge of that well-known sadness
And I have to sit down for a while
The feeling that I'm losing her forever
And without really entering her world
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter
That funny little girl
Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it, slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind?
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing, slipping through my fingers all the time
Sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table
Barely awake, I let precious time go by
Then when she's gone, there's that odd melancholy feeling
And a sense of guilt I can't deny
What happened to those wonderful adventures?
The places I had planned for us to go? (Slipping through my fingers all the time)
Well, some of that we did, but most, we didn't
And why? I just don't know
Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it, slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind?
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing, slipping through my fingers all the time
Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture
And save it from the funny tricks of time
Slipping through my fingers
Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smileSchoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning

Take it
If she gives you her heart
Don't you break it
Let your arms be a place
She feels safe in
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She always has trouble
Falling asleep
And she likes to cuddle
While under the sheets
She loves Pop songs
And dancing, and bad trash TV
There's still a few other things
She loves love notes and babies
And likes giving gifts
Has a hard time accepting
A good compliment
She loves her whole family
And all of her friends
So if you're the one she lets in
Take it
If she gives you her heart
Don't you break it
Let your arms be a place
She feels safe in
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you
If you love her
On days when
It feels like the whole
World might cave in
Stand side by side
And you'll make it
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you
If you love her like that
Kiss her with passion
As much as you can
Run your hands through her hair
Whenever she's sad
And when she doesn't notice
How pretty she is
Tell her over and over
So she never forgets
Take it
If she gives you her heart
Don't you break it
Let your arms be a place
She feels safe in
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you
If you love her
On days when
It feels like the whole
World might cave in
Stand side by side
And you'll make it
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you
If you love her like that
She'll love you
If you love her like that
She'll love you
If you love her
She'll love you
If you love her like that
She'll love you
She'll love you
She'll love you
She'll love you
If you love her
On days when
It feels like the whole
World might cave in
Stand side by side
And you'll make it
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you
If you love her like that

There are times when I'm lying in my bed
How I bellow and cry from this stupid gate
And my eyes are like windshields on a rainy day
Almost rubbed-down, swelling
As I keep on dipping my face in these cold hands of mine
Heaven knows how embittered I am
'Cause this angel has flown away from me
Leaving me with drunken misery
I should have clipped her wings
And made her mine for all eternity
Now, this angel has flown away from me
Thought I had the strength to set her free
Did what I did because I love her so
Will she ever find her way back home to me? Oh-oh
I'm so tired, I feel like catching 40 winks
Being up all night in this elbow room
That puts me in a trance
Where hopes and dreams come true
Now, my lips are burning
And my eyes are hurting
From these fumes I make, still, I light another cigarette
Just to pass my time, oh
Heaven knows how embittered I am
'Cause this angel has flown away from me
Leaving me with drunken misery
I should have clipped her wings
And made her mine for all eternity
Now, this angel has flown away from me
Thought I had the strength to set her free
Did what I did because I love her so
Will she ever find her way back home to me? Oh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh



Little do you know
How I'm breakin' while you fall asleep
Little do you know
I'm still haunted by the memories
Little do you know
I'm tryin' to pick myself up piece by piece
Little do you know
I need a little more time
Underneath it all I'm held captive by the hole inside
I've been holding back for the fear that you might change your mind
I'm ready to forgive you, but forgettin' is a harder fight
Little do you know
I need a little more time
I'll wait, I'll wait
I love you like you've never felt the pain
I'll wait
I promise you don't have to be afraid
I'll wait
Love is here and here to stay
So lay your head on me
Little do you know
I know you're hurt while I'm sound asleep
Little do you know
All my mistakes are slowly drownin' me
Little do you know
I'm tryin' to make it better piece by piece
Little do you know I
I love you 'til the sun dies
Oh wait, just wait
I love you like I've never felt the pain
Just wait
I love you like I've never been afraid
Just wait
Our love is here, and here to stay
So lay your head on me
I'll wait (I'll wait), I'll wait (I'll wait)
I love you like you've never felt the pain
I'll wait (I'll wait)
I promise you don't have to be afraid
I'll wait
Love is here, and here to stay
So lay your head on me
Lay your head on me
So lay your head on me
'Cause little do you know I
I love you 'til the sun dies



If you leave me don't you ever think I want you go
'Cause I'm bound to you
All I need is you to wait for me and I'll be there for you
'Cause I'll run to you
My heart belongs to you
I'll take a piece of you
I don't know what's happening now
And all a lot thing have turned
I wish that I could turned back time
Back when I'm with you
But my heart belongs to you
I'll take a piece of you
My heart belongs to you
I'll take a piece of you
My heart belongs to you
I'll take a piece of you
My heart belongs to you
I'll take a piece of you

Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile
I watch her go with a surge of that well-known sadness
And I have to sit down for a while
The feeling that I'm losing her forever
And without really entering her world
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter
That funny little girl
Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it, slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind?
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing, slipping through my fingers all the time
Sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table
Barely awake, I let precious time go by
Then when she's gone, there's that odd melancholy feeling
And a sense of guilt I can't deny
What happened to those wonderful adventures?
The places I had planned for us to go? (Slipping through my fingers all the time)
Well, some of that we did, but most, we didn't
And why? I just don't know
Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it, slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind?
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing, slipping through my fingers all the time
Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture
And save it from the funny tricks of time
Slipping through my fingers
Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smileSchoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning

Take it
If she gives you her heart
Don't you break it
Let your arms be a place
She feels safe in
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She always has trouble
Falling asleep
And she likes to cuddle
While under the sheets
She loves Pop songs
And dancing, and bad trash TV
There's still a few other things
She loves love notes and babies
And likes giving gifts
Has a hard time accepting
A good compliment
She loves her whole family
And all of her friends
So if you're the one she lets in
Take it
If she gives you her heart
Don't you break it
Let your arms be a place
She feels safe in
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you
If you love her
On days when
It feels like the whole
World might cave in
Stand side by side
And you'll make it
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you
If you love her like that
Kiss her with passion
As much as you can
Run your hands through her hair
Whenever she's sad
And when she doesn't notice
How pretty she is
Tell her over and over
So she never forgets
Take it
If she gives you her heart
Don't you break it
Let your arms be a place
She feels safe in
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you
If you love her
On days when
It feels like the whole
World might cave in
Stand side by side
And you'll make it
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you
If you love her like that
She'll love you
If you love her like that
She'll love you
If you love her
She'll love you
If you love her like that
She'll love you
She'll love you
She'll love you
She'll love you
If you love her
On days when
It feels like the whole
World might cave in
Stand side by side
And you'll make it
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you
If you love her like that

Why do birds suddenly appear
Every time you are near?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
Why do stars fall down from the sky
Every time you walk by?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
On the day that you were born the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
On the day that you were born the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust in your hair of gold
And starlight in your eyes of blue
That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
Wa, close to you
Wa, close to you
Ha, close to you
La, close to you

I don't really give a damn about the way you touch me
When we're alone
You can hold my hand
If no one's home
Do you like it when I'm away?
If I went and hurt my body, baby
Would you love me the same?
I can feel all my bones coming back
And I'm craving motion
Mama never really learned how to live by herself
It's a curse
And it's growing
You're a pond and I'm an ocean
Oh, all my emotions
Feel like explosions when you are around
And I've found a way to kill the sounds, oh
Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
I broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden?
Oh, and if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
I said no (I said no), I said no (I said no)
Listen close, it's a no
The wind is a-pounding on my back
And I found hope in a heart attack
Oh at last, it has passed
Now I've got it, and you can't have it
Baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
I broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden, oh
And if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide
Darling, when I'm fast asleep
I've seen this person watching me
Saying, "Is it worth it? Is it worth it? Tell me, is it worth it?"
Oh
'Cause there is something, and there is nothing
There is nothing in between
And in my eyes, there is a tiny dancer
Watching over me, he's singing
"She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a boy"
He's singing, "She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a line without a hook"
Oh baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you
I need you here to stay
I broke all my bones that day I found you
Crying at the lake
Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden, oh
And if I could take it all back
I swear that I would pull you from the tide

She is something to behold
Elegant and bold
She is electricity
Running to my soul
Oh, oh, oh, oh
And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me
Will work each time
Calling me to come back to bed
Singing Georgia On My Mind
And I, and I
Lips generous and warm
You build me up like steps
Eyes innocent and wild
Remind me what it's like
Oh, oh, oh, oh
And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Pulling me back into the flames
And I'm burning up again
I'm burning up
And I, I never understood what was at stake
I never thought your love was worth it's wait
Well now you've come and gone
I finally worked it out
I worked it out
I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want it troubling your mind
Won't you let it be
I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want it troubling your mind
Won't you let it be
I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want it troubling your mind
Won't you let it be
I never should have told you
I never should have let you see inside
Don't want it troubling your mind
Won't you let it be
And I could easily lose my mind
The way you kiss me will work each time
Pulling me back into the flames
And I'm burning up again, I'm burning up
And I, I never understood what was at stake
I never thought your love was worth it's wait
Well now you've come and gone
I finally worked it out
I worked it out
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ooh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Aking sinta ikaw na ang tahanan at mundo (mundo'y magiging ikaw)
Sa pagbalik mananatili na sa piling mo(mundo'y magiging ikaw)
Aking sinta (limutin na ang mundo)
Ikaw na ang tahanan at mundo (nang magkasama tayo mundo'y magiging ikaw)
Sa pagbalik (sunod sa bawat galaw)
Mananatili na sa piling mo (hindi na maliligaw mundo'y magiging ikaw)
Limutin na ang mundo
Nang magkasama tayo
Sunod sa bawat galaw
Hindi na maliligaw
Mundo'y magiging ikaw

There are times when I'm lying in my bed
How I bellow and cry from this stupid gate
And my eyes are like windshields on a rainy day
Almost rubbed-down, swelling
As I keep on dipping my face in these cold hands of mine
Heaven knows how embittered I am
'Cause this angel has flown away from me
Leaving me with drunken misery
I should have clipped her wings
And made her mine for all eternity
Now, this angel has flown away from me
Thought I had the strength to set her free
Did what I did because I love her so
Will she ever find her way back home to me? Oh-oh
I'm so tired, I feel like catching 40 winks
Being up all night in this elbow room
That puts me in a trance
Where hopes and dreams come true
Now, my lips are burning
And my eyes are hurting
From these fumes I make, still, I light another cigarette
Just to pass my time, oh
Heaven knows how embittered I am
'Cause this angel has flown away from me
Leaving me with drunken misery
I should have clipped her wings
And made her mine for all eternity
Now, this angel has flown away from me
Thought I had the strength to set her free
Did what I did because I love her so
Will she ever find her way back home to me? Oh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh



Little do you know
How I'm breakin' while you fall asleep
Little do you know
I'm still haunted by the memories
Little do you know
I'm tryin' to pick myself up piece by piece
Little do you know
I need a little more time
Underneath it all I'm held captive by the hole inside
I've been holding back for the fear that you might change your mind
I'm ready to forgive you, but forgettin' is a harder fight
Little do you know
I need a little more time
I'll wait, I'll wait
I love you like you've never felt the pain
I'll wait
I promise you don't have to be afraid
I'll wait
Love is here and here to stay
So lay your head on me
Little do you know
I know you're hurt while I'm sound asleep
Little do you know
All my mistakes are slowly drownin' me
Little do you know
I'm tryin' to make it better piece by piece
Little do you know I
I love you 'til the sun dies
Oh wait, just wait
I love you like I've never felt the pain
Just wait
I love you like I've never been afraid
Just wait
Our love is here, and here to stay
So lay your head on me
I'll wait (I'll wait), I'll wait (I'll wait)
I love you like you've never felt the pain
I'll wait (I'll wait)
I promise you don't have to be afraid
I'll wait
Love is here, and here to stay
So lay your head on me
Lay your head on me
So lay your head on me
'Cause little do you know I
I love you 'til the sun dies



If you leave me don't you ever think I want you go
'Cause I'm bound to you
All I need is you to wait for me and I'll be there for you
'Cause I'll run to you
My heart belongs to you
I'll take a piece of you
I don't know what's happening now
And all a lot thing have turned
I wish that I could turned back time
Back when I'm with you
But my heart belongs to you
I'll take a piece of you
My heart belongs to you
I'll take a piece of you
My heart belongs to you
I'll take a piece of you
My heart belongs to you
I'll take a piece of you

Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smile
I watch her go with a surge of that well-known sadness
And I have to sit down for a while
The feeling that I'm losing her forever
And without really entering her world
I'm glad whenever I can share her laughter
That funny little girl
Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it, slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind?
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing, slipping through my fingers all the time
Sleep in our eyes, her and me at the breakfast table
Barely awake, I let precious time go by
Then when she's gone, there's that odd melancholy feeling
And a sense of guilt I can't deny
What happened to those wonderful adventures?
The places I had planned for us to go? (Slipping through my fingers all the time)
Well, some of that we did, but most, we didn't
And why? I just don't know
Slipping through my fingers all the time
I try to capture every minute
The feeling in it, slipping through my fingers all the time
Do I really see what's in her mind?
Each time I think I'm close to knowing
She keeps on growing, slipping through my fingers all the time
Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture
And save it from the funny tricks of time
Slipping through my fingers
Schoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning
Waving goodbye with an absent-minded smileSchoolbag in hand, she leaves home in the early morning

Take it
If she gives you her heart
Don't you break it
Let your arms be a place
She feels safe in
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She always has trouble
Falling asleep
And she likes to cuddle
While under the sheets
She loves Pop songs
And dancing, and bad trash TV
There's still a few other things
She loves love notes and babies
And likes giving gifts
Has a hard time accepting
A good compliment
She loves her whole family
And all of her friends
So if you're the one she lets in
Take it
If she gives you her heart
Don't you break it
Let your arms be a place
She feels safe in
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you
If you love her
On days when
It feels like the whole
World might cave in
Stand side by side
And you'll make it
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you
If you love her like that
Kiss her with passion
As much as you can
Run your hands through her hair
Whenever she's sad
And when she doesn't notice
How pretty she is
Tell her over and over
So she never forgets
Take it
If she gives you her heart
Don't you break it
Let your arms be a place
She feels safe in
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you
If you love her
On days when
It feels like the whole
World might cave in
Stand side by side
And you'll make it
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you
If you love her like that
She'll love you
If you love her like that
She'll love you
If you love her
She'll love you
If you love her like that
She'll love you
She'll love you
She'll love you
She'll love you
If you love her
On days when
It feels like the whole
World might cave in
Stand side by side
And you'll make it
She's the best thing that you'll ever have
She'll love you
If you love her like that
